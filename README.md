# Yelp-Dataset

This is a submission I made for the individual coursework of COMP0047 Data Science at UCL during my master's degree from 2021 to 2022.

The task was to analyse the Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 13 by positing a research question and extracting information from the dataset into a 1500 word report. My research question was: How consistent are the ratings of McDonaldâ€™s chains across North America.

This repository contains the code used for my report. As the report was quite brief, the materials here are reflective of the stated limitations.
In this report, we conducted normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, D'Agostino, Anderson-Darling), examine kurtosis, skewness, entropy, mapped the Central Limit Theorem, and Bootstrapped Variance estimators.
